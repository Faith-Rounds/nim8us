# nim8us - Anti-Deepfake Provenance System

> Making deepfakes irrelevant by proving what's real

## üìù Summary

nim8us establishes trust in digital media through cross-chain provenance verification, combining Flare's price oracles with XRPL's NFTs to combat deepfakes.

## üéØ What It Does

nim8us creates tamper-proof certificates for images, especially to combat deepfakes:

- **Companies** can prove content authenticity  
- **Platforms** can verify images before publishing
- **Users** can check if images are real or fake

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Flare Smart Contracts**: Immutable provenance records + FTSO pricing
- **XRPL NFTs**: Tradeable authenticity certificates  
- **Cross-Chain**: Programmable liquidity for verified content

## üöÄ Quick Demo

```bash
# Setup (5 minutes)
./setup-demo.sh

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Drag images to verify authenticity
```

### üé¨ Demo Flow

- Upload authentic image ‚Üí ‚úÖ VERIFIED
- Upload modified image ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è MODIFIED (shows changes)
- Upload unknown image ‚Üí ‚ùì UNKNOWN
- Check blockchain proof ‚Üí Links to Flare + XRPL

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Components

### Backend API (Express + TypeScript)

- Image processing and normalization
- Content hash generation
- Similarity detection for modified images
- FTSO price simulation

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)

- ProofRegistry.sol: Main contract for image certification
- Uses FTSO for price oracles
- Creates tamper-proof provenance records

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- Drag-and-drop interface
- Realtime verification results
- Blockchain explorer integration
- Demo mode for presentations

- **Creative Industries**: Protect original digital assets
- **NFT Markets**: Ensure authenticity of digital assets

## üîç Full Description

### The Problem

Deepfakes and manipulated media are rapidly eroding trust in digital content. Current approaches that try to detect fake images are in a constant arms race with ever-improving AI generation capabilities. Rather than focusing on detecting what's fake, nim8us offers a paradigm shift by definitively proving what's real.

Key problems nim8us addresses:

1. **Trust Gap**: News organizations, legal systems, and social platforms struggle to verify the authenticity of digital content
2. **Detection Limitations**: AI-based deepfake detectors constantly need updates as generation technology improves
3. **Provenance Tracking**: No standardized way to track the origin and history of digital content
4. **Cross-Platform Verification**: Lack of interoperable standards for content authentication

### Our Solution

nim8us uses a cross-chain approach leveraging the complementary strengths of Flare and XRPL:

**Flare Network Integration:**

- Smart contracts for immutable certification records
- FTSO price feeds to dynamically set certification fees
- State Connector to provide cross-chain interoperability
- Attestation layer for verifying content without revealing it

**XRPL Integration:**

- NFTs for tradeable proof of authenticity
- Fast and low-cost settlement of authenticity certificates
- Long-term archival of verification records
- Decentralized discovery of authentic content

By combining these blockchain technologies, nim8us creates an unbroken chain of provenance that makes verification as simple as taking a photo. We're not trying to detect what's fake - we're proving what's real.

## üß∞ Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack & SDKs

- **Flare SDK**: Used for smart contract interactions and FTSO queries
- **FTSO Data Provider API**: For real-time price data to calculate dynamic fees
- **Flare State Connector**: Enabling cross-chain verification of image certificates
- **XRPL JS SDK**: For NFT minting and querying of authenticity certificates
- **XRPL Hooks**: (Planned) For on-ledger verification logic
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based verification and certification contracts
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript for API layer
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS with glassmorphism design

### Unique Cross-Chain Features

1. **Flare + XRPL Synergy**: Flare's smart contract capabilities combined with XRPL's efficient transaction processing creates a unique solution impossible on either chain alone

2. **FTSO-Based Dynamic Pricing**: Leverages Flare's decentralized price oracles to ensure certification fees remain stable in USD terms despite cryptocurrency volatility

3. **Cross-Chain Attestations**: Images certified on Flare can be verified on XRPL and vice versa, creating a seamless verification experience

4. **Trustless Verification**: The verification process is entirely on-chain and doesn't require trusting a central authority
